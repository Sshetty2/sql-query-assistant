"""
Test the orphaned filter column heuristic in the join synthesizer.

This tests the fix for the issue where the planner marks a column as role="filter"
but forgets to create the actual FilterPredicate, resulting in the column being
neither displayed nor filtered on.

Observed behavior (before fix):
- User query: "List all applications tagged with security risk"
- Planner marked TagName as role="filter"
- But planner FORGOT to create the filter predicate (filters: [])
- Result: TagName was neither displayed NOR filtered on!

The heuristic ensures orphaned filter columns are treated as projections to ensure visibility.
